# Identification of Marek’s disease virus genes associated with virulence of US strains

A comparative genomic analysis of field isolates of Marek’s disease virus (Gallid alphaherpesvirus 2) collected primarily within the United States. Five samples underwent whole genome sequencing (same names contain ‘WGS’) and the remainder underwent targeted DNA sequencing.

Project designed and implemented by John Dunn (John.Dunn@ars.usda.gov), Hans Cheng (Hans.Cheng@ars.usda.gov), Alexis Black-Pyrkosz (ablackpz@msu.edu), and Alec Steep (alec.steep@gmail.com).
